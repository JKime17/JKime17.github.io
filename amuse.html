    <h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>
    <h3>by Steven Sanchez</h3>
    <p>Hi there!  Here is a website of my 3 favorite sites that I find both interesting and amusing!</p>
   
    <h2>Activities Around the World</h2>
    <p>This first website highlights all of the fun and interesting places around America and the world. It gives a small description of the places advertised and says where they are and any information needed before you go. I have always been interested in travelling, and this is a very useful website that helps for if I need things to do.</p>

    <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; Fresh Laughs</h2>
    <p>Reddit is a great place to find fresh new laughs.  The Jokes subreddit has a mix of old and new jokes to keep things funny.  However, I can't always vouche for how clean the jokes are...</p>

    <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
    <p>Sadly, there's no guarantee a particular page or even an entire website will be around forever.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>.  I have fond memories of this site listing out some of the best Chuck Norris facts, some of which have lived their way on to infamy.  Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
