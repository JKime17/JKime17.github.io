 <h2> What is a Hero?</h2>
          <p>When I am asked what a hero is, I of course think of the cape and masked vigilante that is portrayed in movies going around and saving the day.<br>One thing that isn't portrayed too often is the real life heroes that live among us everyday, inspiring the people around them to be their best selves.</p>
    <p>  To me, Michael Phelps has to be my personal hero. I think the thing that stands out to me is his activism in being your best personal self. He talks a lot about how you need to be confident with yourself and embrace all of your flaws and strengths and really utilize what you are given to unlock your true potential.<br><br>Another thing he is vocal about is following your dreams and finding ways to make them a reality. If you find a passion in your life, pursue it. Find healthy avenues to get to where you want to be and don't let people holdyou back. You have to show determination and resiliance to get to where you want to go.<br><br>I am truly inspired by Michael every day, as he is the reason I work towards my goals in getting better at disc golf. Because of his mindset, I get up everyday, rain or shine and practice wether it be watching videos on form and technique, practicing out on a real course, or sitting in front of a basket practicing short distance. I have been at this for 11 years now and have officially gotten accredidation by the Professional Disc Golf Association and am working on getting myself onto the Pro Tour.</p>
